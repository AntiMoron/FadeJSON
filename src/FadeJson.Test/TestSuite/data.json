The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.<br /><br />\n\nThis table contains data on educational attainment from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for states.

For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.<br /><br />\n\nThis table contains data on language ability and linguistic isolation from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for block groups. Linguistic isolation is defined as no one 14 and over speaks English only or speaks English \"very well\". The American Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides communities with the current information they need to plan investments and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire nation.\n\t  This table also has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for each estimated element.  MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element.  So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30).  There are also special cases of MOE.  An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured error.  An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value.  An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0.\n      The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated.  This process means using standard error calculations as described in \"American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)\".  Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error.

The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.

Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.<br /><br />\n\nThis table contains data on household income and poverty status from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for tracts.  The American Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides communities with the current information they need to plan investments and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire nation.\n\t  This table also has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for each estimated element.  MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element.  So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30).  There are also special cases of MOE.  An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured error.  An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value.  An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0.\n      The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated.  This process means using standard error calculations as described in \"American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)\".  Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error.  Due to the complexity of the calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level MOE tables).<br /><br />\n\nThe name for table 'ACS10INCTRMOE' was added as a prefix to all field names imported from that table.

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census.  For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. \n\nThis table contains housing data derived from the U.S. Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for block groups.

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.

The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Although the records for these grant locations are drawn directly from the official EPA grants repository (IGMS \ufffd Integrated Grants Management System), it is important to know that the IGMS was designed for purposes that did not include accurately portraying the grant\ufffds place of performance on a map.  Instead, the IGMS grant recipient\ufffds mailing address is the primary source for grant locations.  Particularly for statewide grants that are administered via State and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should not be interpreted as the grant\ufffds place of performance.  In 2012, a policy was established to start to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded grants \ufffd that were deemed \ufffdcommunity-based\ufffd in nature and for these the grant location depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of the actual place of performance.  As for the locational accuracy of these points, there is no programmatic certification process, however, they are being entered by the Grant Project Officers who are most familiar with the details of the grants, apart from the grantees themselves.

There are many limitations to the data so it is advised that these metadata be read carefully before use.  Although the records for these grant locations are drawn directly from the official EPA grants repository (IGMS ?? Integrated Grants Management System), it is important to know that the IGMS was designed for purposes that did not include accurately portraying the grant??s place of performance on a map.  Instead, the IGMS grant recipient??s mailing address is the primary source for grant locations.  Particularly for statewide grants that are administered via State and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should not be interpreted as the grant??s place of performance.  In 2012, a policy was established to start to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded grants ?? that were deemed ??community-based?? in nature and for these the grant location depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of the actual place of performance.  As for the locational accuracy of these points, there is no programmatic certification process, however, they are being entered by the Grant Project Officers who are most familiar with the details of the grants, apart from the grantees themselves.  Limitations notwithstanding, this is a first-of-breed attempt to map all of the Agency??s grants, using the best internal geocoding algorithms available, and is a useful tool for getting to an understanding of the distribution of USEPA grant-giving.\n\nApart from the \"community-based\" grants that have been targeted for update with actual place of performance information, this dataset is improved on a regular basis with updates for the place of performance for Brownfields and related grant programs with a nightly refresh with the ACRES database (http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/pubs/acres/).", "keyword": ["united states", "grants"], "title": "USEPA Grants", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://edg.epa.gov/data/Restricted/OEI/OIAA/GeoGrantsGDB.gdb.zip", "format": "API", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}, {"downloadURL": "http://edg.epa.gov/data/Restricted/OEI/OIAA/GeoGrantsGDB.gdb.zip", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}], "rights": "These Data Are Restricted to Internal EPA Personnel Only", "modified": "2012-02-15", "landingPage": "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B169C612D-2489-4CC9-9851-75D07190B057%7D", "bureauCode": ["020:00"], "references": ["http://edg.epa.gov/data/Restricted/OEI/OIAA/GeoGrantsGDB.gdb.zip", "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/rest/document?id=%7B169C612D-2489-4CC9-9851-75D07190B057%7D", "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B169C612D-2489-4CC9-9851-75D07190B057%7D"], "accrualPeriodicity": "irregular", "spatial": "-174.20005,17.70101,-64.6851,71.29507", "programCode": ["020:072"], "license": "https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.html", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:balassiano.kim@epa.gov", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Environmental Information, Kim Balassiano"}, "identifier": "{169C612D-2489-4CC9-9851-75D07190B057}", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) - National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL)"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile.

There are many limitations to the data so it is advised that these metadata be read carefully before use. Although the records for these grant locations are drawn directly from the official EPA grants repository (IGMS Integrated Grants Management System), it is important to know that the IGMS was designed for purposes that did not include accurately portraying the grants place of performance on a map. Instead, the IGMS grant recipients mailing address is the primary source for grant locations. Particularly for statewide grants that are administered via State and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should not be interpreted as the grants place of performance. In 2012, a policy was established to start to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded grants that were deemed community-based in nature and for these the grant location depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of the actual place of performance. As for the locational accuracy of these points, there is no programmatic certification process, however, they are being entered by the Grant Project Officers who are most familiar with the details of the grants, apart from the grantees themselves. Limitations notwithstanding, this is a first-of-breed attempt to map all of the Agencys grants, using the best internal geocoding algorithms available, and is a useful tool for getting to an understanding of the distribution of USEPA grant-giving. The EJ Grants layer contains Places of Performance for single locations or areas where EJ grants are applied. This layer consists of grant data that is derived from an Environmental Justice grant program. This includes any grants that have a Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) code identifier of 66.604, signifying Environmental Justice Hazardous Substances Research Small Grants to Community Groups and Environmental Justice Small Grants Program for Community Research. It also contains any grant whose program code acronym is equivalent to EJ (Environmental Justice Community/University Partnership Grants Program), EQ (Environmental Justice Small Grant Program), TJ (State and Tribal Grants for Environmental Justice), PS (Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Grants Program), EP (Environmental Justice Assistance), or RJ (Environmental Justice Research Assistance). In addition to the above program code and CFDA code criteria, this data contains grants from the following grant programs: Environmental Justice Pollution Prevention Grants Program Surveys, Studies, Investigations, and Special Purpose Activities Relating to Environmental Justice Environmental Justice Training and Fellowship Assistance Assistance to Nonprofit Organizations with Activities Relating to Environmental Justice Environmental Justice Hazardous Substances Research Small Grants to Community Groups State Environmental Justice Cooperative Agreement Program", "keyword": ["united states", "environmental justice", "grants"], "title": "US EPA EJ Grants", "rights": "None", "modified": "2012-04-27", "landingPage": "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B1CD3FBEA-0925-429B-8AAE-DDA1B5CA5489%7D", "bureauCode": ["020:00"], "references": ["https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B1CD3FBEA-0925-429B-8AAE-DDA1B5CA5489%7D", "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/rest/document?id=%7B1CD3FBEA-0925-429B-8AAE-DDA1B5CA5489%7D"], "accrualPeriodicity": "irregular", "spatial": "-174.20005,17.70101,-64.6851,71.29507", "programCode": ["020:072"], "license": "https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.htm", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:balassiano.kim@epa.gov", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Environmental Information, Kim Balassiano"}, "identifier": "{1CD3FBEA-0925-429B-8AAE-DDA1B5CA5489}", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) - National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL)"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile.

By integrating data reported by the recipients of Recovery Act funding and data created by EPA, this application delivers a level of transparency and public accessibility to users interested in EPA's use of Recovery Act monies. The application is relatively easy to use and builds on the same mapping model as Google, Bing, MapQuest and other commonly used mapping interfaces. EPA Recovery Mapper tracks each award made by each program and gives basic Quick Facts information for each award including award name, location, award date, dollar amounts and more. Data Summaries for each EPA program or for each state are provided displaying dollars for Total Awarded, Total Received (Paid), and Total Jobs This Quarter by Recovery for the latest quarter of data released by Recovery.gov. The data are reported to the government and EPA four times a year by the award recipients. The latest quarterly report will always be displayed in the EPA Recovery Mapper. In addition, the application provides many details about each award. Users will learn more about how to access and interpret these data later in this document. Data shown in the EPA Recovery Mapper are derived from information reported back to FederalReporting.gov from the recipients of Recovery Act funding. EPA reviews the recipient reported data and works with the recipients to correct the data when errors are found. Please note that the dollar amounts displayed at Recovery.gov may differ somewhat from the amounts in this application because EPA Recovery Mapper includes awards that EPA has funded for Superfund sites cleanups that were awarded by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Also, EPA Recovery Mapper also does not display awards for management and oversight and awards made to EPA's Inspector General which account for less than 1.4% of the Recovery Act funding that EPA has received.", "keyword": ["environment"], "title": "EPA Recovery Mapper", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://epamap17.epa.gov/arra/", "format": "API", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}, {"downloadURL": "http://epamap17.epa.gov/arra/", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}], "rights": "None.", "modified": "2011-01-01", "theme": ["environment"], "landingPage": "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7BB756C475-07D8-4509-8427-E4FB3E28CBCC%7D", "bureauCode": ["020:00"], "references": ["https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/rest/document?id=%7BB756C475-07D8-4509-8427-E4FB3E28CBCC%7D", "http://www.epa.gov/recovery/", "http://epamap17.epa.gov/arra/", "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7BB756C475-07D8-4509-8427-E4FB3E28CBCC%7D"], "accrualPeriodicity": "irregular", "spatial": "-176.6525,13.3949,145.72,70.64818", "programCode": ["020:072"], "license": "https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.html", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:smith.davidg@epa.gov", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Environmental Information, Office of Information Collection, David G.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005).

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.\n\n        SF1 Table\n        This table contains housing data derived from the U.S. Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for population.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census.  For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.\n        ATTRIBUTES\n        This table contains population data derived from the U.S. Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for block groups.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by non visible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census.  For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.<br /><br />\n\nThis table contains data on household income and poverty status from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for block groups.  The American Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides communities with the current information they need to plan investments and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire nation.\n\t  This table also has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for each estimated element.  MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element.  So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30).  There are also special cases of MOE.  An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured error.  An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value.  An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0.\n      The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated.  This process means using standard error calculations as described in \"American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)\".  Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error.  Due to the complexity of the calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level MOE tables).<br /><br />\n\nThe name for table 'ACS10INCBGMOE' was added as a prefix to all field names imported from that table.

The NARS analysis examined the range of values for nutrients in least-disturbed sites in a WSA region [WSA regions are modified Level III ecoregions from Omernik (1987)] and used this distribution for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to separate sites into those having high, medium, or low concentrations of nutrients. Sites identified as \"high\" were worse (i.e., had higher nutrient concentrations) than 95% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition. Similarly, the 75th percentile of the least-disturbed distribution was used to distinguish between sites in medium and low condition. This means that sites reported as being as \"low\" were as good as or better than 75% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition. A relative risk analysis of the data from this survey found that nationally streams and lakes have more than two times greater risk of having degraded biological communities when nutrient concentrations are high than when they are low.

Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).\n\n\tLiterature cited:\n\tCommission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997, Ecological regions of North America- toward a common perspective: Montreal, Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 71 p.\n\n\tGallant, A.

The following data sources (and layers) are contained in this service:\nUSEPA's 2005 National-Scale Air Toxic Assessment (NATA) data. Data are shown at the census tract level (2000 census tract boundaries, US Census Bureau) for Cumulative Cancer and Non-Cancer risks (Neurological and Respiratory) from 139 air toxics. In addition, individual pollutant estimates of Ambient Concentration, Exposure Concentration, Cancer, and Non-Cancer risks (Neurological and Respiratory) are provided for: Acetaldehyde, Acrolein, Arsenic, Benzene, 1,3-Butadiene, Chromium, Diesel PM, Formaldehyde, Lead, Naphthalene, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH).   \nThe original Access tables were downloaded from USEPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/tables.html. The data classification (defined interval) for this map service was developed for USEPA's Office of Research and Development's (ORD) Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (C-FERST) per guidance provided by OAR.\nThe 2005 NATA provides information on 177 of the 187 Clean Air Act air toxics (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/05pdf/2005polls.pdf) plus diesel particulate matter (diesel PM was assessed for non-cancer only). For additional information about NATA, go to http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/05pdf/nata_tmd.pdf or contact Ted Palma, USEPA (palma.ted@epa.gov). NATA data disclaimer: USEPA strongly cautions that these modeling results are most meaningful when viewed at the state or national level, and should not be used to draw conclusions about local exposures or risks (e.g., to compare local areas, to identify the exact location of \"hot spots\", or to revise or design emission reduction programs). Substantial uncertainties with the input data for these models may cause the results to misrepresent actual risks, especially at the census tract level. However, we believe the census tract data and maps can provide a useful approximation of geographic patterns of variation in risk within counties. For example, a cluster of census tracts with higher estimated risks may suggest the existence of a \"hot spot,\" although the specific tracts affected will be uncertain. More refined assessments based on additional data and analysis would be needed to better characterize such risks at the tract level. (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/countyxls/cancer_risk02_county_042009.xls). Note that these modeled estimates are derived from outdoor sources only; indoor sources are not included in these examples, but may be significant in some cases. The modeled exposure estimates are for a median individual in the geographic area shown. Note that in some cases the estimated relationship between human exposure and health effect may be calculated as a high end estimate, and thus may be more likely to overestimate than underestimate actual health effects for the median individual in the geographic area shown. Other limitations to consider when looking at the results are detailed on the EPA 2005 NATA website. For these reasons, the NATA maps included in C-FERST are provided for screening purposes only. \nSee the 2005 National Air Toxic Assessment website for recommended usage and limitations on the estimated cancer and noncancer data provided above. \n\nUSEPA's NonAttainment areas data. C-FERST displays Ozone for 8-hour Ozone based on the 1997 standard for reporting and Particulate Matter PM-2.5 based on the 2006 standard for reporting. These are areas of the country where air pollution levels consistently exceed the national ambient air quality standards. Details about the USEPA's NonAttainment data are available at http://www.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. \n\nCenter of Disease Control's (CDC) Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) data. Averaged over three years (2004 - 2006). The USEPA's ORD calculated a three-year average (2004 - 2006) using the values for Ozone (number of days with the maximum 8-hour average above the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)) and PM 2.5 (annual ambient concentration). These data were extracted by the CDC from the USEPA's ambient air monitors and are displayed at the county level. USEPA received the Monitor and Modeled data from the CDC and calculated the three year average displayed in the web service.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.

ACS estimates provides communities with the current information they need to plan investments and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually.

MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element.  So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30).  There are also special cases of MOE.  An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured error.  An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value.  An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0.\n      The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated.  This process means using standard error calculations as described in \"American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)\".  Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error.

Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census.  For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.<br /><br />\n\nThis table contains data on educational attainment from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for block groups.

They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).    \n\nLiterature cited:   \n\nCommission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997, Ecological regions of North America- toward a common perspective: Montreal, Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 71 p.   \n\nGallant, A.

The snapshot constitutes the top water impairments. \n\nThe Impaired Waters with TMDLs and the 303(d) Listed Impaired Waters are combined into three mapping service layers in MyWaters Mapper application to provide a comprehensive view of each of these impairments.  These waters are linked to the 303(d) information stored in EPAs Assessment and TMDL Tracking and Implementation System (ATTAINS). Below is a brief description of the two programs.\n\nThe 303(d) Listed Impaired Waters program system provides impaired water data and impaired water features reflecting river segments, lakes, and estuaries designated under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Each State will establish Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these waters. Note the CWA Section 303(d) list of impaired waters does not represent waters that are impaired but have an EPA-approved TMDL established, impaired waters for which other pollution control mechanisms are in place and expected to attain water quality standards, or waters impaired as a result of pollution and is not caused by a pollutant; therefore, the \"Impaired Waters\" layers do not represent all impaired waters reported in a state's Integrated Report, but only the waters comprised of a state's approved 303(d) list. For more information regarding impaired waters refer to EPA's Integrated Reporting Guidance at: http://www.epa.gov/owow/tmdl/guidance.html 303(d) Waterbodies are coded onto NHD linear and area features to create Linear, Polygonal and Point Events. Point events represent impaired waterbody segments that do not fall on an NHD reach. 303(d) Waterbodies are coded onto NHD Waterbody reaches (region.rch) to create datasets. In addition to NHD reach indexed data there may also be custom event data (point, line, or polygon) that are not associated with NHD and are in an EPA standard format that is compatible with EPA's Reach Address Database. These custom features are used to represent locations of 303(d) waterbodies that are not represented well in NHD.\n\nThe Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Tracking System contains information on waters that are Not Supporting their designated uses. These waters are listed by the state as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. The status of TMDLs are also tracked. TMDLs are pollution control measures that reduce the discharge of pollutants into impaired waters. A TMDL or Total Maximum Daily Load is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's sources. What is a total maximum daily load (TMDL)? Water quality standards are set by States, Territories, and Tribes. They identify the uses for each waterbody, for example, drinking water supply, contact recreation (swimming), and aquatic life support (fishing), and the scientific criteria to support that use. A TMDL is the sum of the allowable loads of a single pollutant from all contributing point and nonpoint sources. The calculation must include a margin of safety to ensure that the waterbody can be used for the purposes the state has designated. The calculation must also account for seasonal variation in water quality.

The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,000-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and \"value-added attributes\" (VAA's). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainageenforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed \"The New-England Method\". This technique involves \"burning-in\" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building \"walls\" using the national WatershedBoundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model(HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHDand WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, over the lasttwo years has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process.The VAAs include greatly enhanced capabilities for upstream and downstream navigation, analysis and modeling. Examples include: retrieve all flowlines (predominantly confluence-to-confluence stream segments) and catchments upstream of a given flowline using queries rather than by slower flowline-by flowline navigation; retrieve flowlines by stream order; subset a stream level path sorted in hydrologic order for stream profile mapping, analysis and plotting; and, calculate cumulative catchment attributes using streamlined VAA hydrologic sequencing routing attributes.The VAAs include results from the use of these cumulative routing techniques, including cumulative drainage areas, precipitation, temperature, and land cover distributions. Several of these cumulative attributes are used to estimate mean annual flow and velocity as part of the VAAs.NHDPlus contains a snapshot (2005) of the 1:100,000-scale NHD that has been extensively improved. While these updates will eventually make their way back to the central NHD repository at USGS, this will not have happened prior to distribution of NHDPlus because the update process for the central NHD repository is still in development. Consequently, the NHDPlus will contain some temporary database keys and, as a result, NHDPlus users may not make updates to the NHD portions of NHDPlus with the intent of sending these updates back to the USGS. Once the NHDPlus updates have been posted to the central NHD repository, a fresh copy of the improved data can be downloaded from the central NHD repository and that copy will be usable for data maintenance.

As of December 2011, there are 968 unique legend items in the Level IV Ecoregion Polygon legend. Follow this link (http://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/33741) for instructions about how to increase the maximum number of ArcGIS Server service layer legend items allowed for display in ArcMap. Note the instructions at this link provide a slightly incorrect path to \"Maximum Legend Count\". The correct path is HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > ESRI > ArcMap > Server > MapServerLayer > Maximum Legend Count. When editing the \"Maximum Legend Count\", update the field, \"Value data\" to 1000. To download a PDF version of the Level IV ecoregion map and legend, go to ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/us/Eco_Level_IV_US_pg.pdf. Please read the remainder of this layer description for general information about Level IV Omernik Ecoregions. This layer represents Level IV Omernik Ecoregions. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. Compilation of the level IV maps, performed at 1:250,000 scale, has been a part of collaborative projects between US Environmental Protection Agency, National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL)--Corvallis, OR, the US Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and a variety of other state and federal resource agencies. The ecoregions and subregions are designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management. The most immediate needs by the states are for developing regional biological criteria and water resource standards, and for setting management goals for nonpoint-source pollution. Level IV ecoregions are intended for large geographic extents (i.e. states, multiple counties, or river basins). Use for smaller areas, such as individual counties or a 1:24,000 scale map boundary, is not recommended. Explanation of the methods used to delineate the ecoregions are given in Omernik (1995), Griffith et al. (1994), and Gallant et al. (1989).

The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States. Pursuant to section 109(d) of the CAA EPA is required to review and promulgate new NAAQS every five years, as appropriate. This ensures that all Americans have the same basic health and environmental protections. The law allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria air pollutants\" because the agency has regulated them by first developing health-based criteria (science-based guidelines) as the basis for setting permissible levels. One set of limits (primary standard) protects health; another set of limits (secondary standard) is intended to prevent environmental and property damage. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas.

Imagery for Oregon was collected in 2012, and imagery for Washington was collected in 2011. In addition, ancillary datasets were derived for the classification from two LiDAR datasets collected in 2007 and one LiDAR dataset collected in 2010. Eight land cover classes were mapped: water, impervious surfaces, soil and barren land, trees and forest, grass and herbaceous non-woody vegetation, agriculture, and wetlands (both woody and emergent). An accuracy assessment using 600 completely random and 54 stratified random land cover reference points yielded an overall accuracy of 78.6%.

Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental\nresource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and\nthe type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally\nsimilar.  The most immediate needs are to develop regional biological\ncriteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint\nsource pollution.\n\nThe approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological\nregions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the\ncomposition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences\nin ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995).  These\nphenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land\nuse, wildlife,  and hydrology.  The relative importance of each characteristic\nvaries from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical\nlevel.  Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for\ndifferent levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme\nhas been adopted for this effort.  Level I is the coarsest level, dividing\nNorth America into 15 ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent\nis subdivided into 52 classes.  Level III is the hierarchical level shown on\nthis map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further\nsubdivided to level IV.

NPL (National Priorities List) sites are hazardous waste sites that are eligible for extensive long-term cleanup under the Superfund program. Eligibility is determined by a scoring method called Hazard Ranking System. Sites with high scores are listed on the NPL.   Area covered by this data set include Arizona, California, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas and Trust Territories.  Attributes include NPL status codes, NPL industry type codes and environmental indicators.  Related table, NPL_Contaminants contains information about contaminated media types and chemicals.  This is a one-to-many relate and can be related to the feature class using the relationship classes under the Feature Data Set ENVIRO_CONTAMINANT.  Generally, each NPL polygon has a separate source.   Information about sources for each polygon can be found in the related table, NPL_POLY_METADATA.  This table contains a record for each site that has information about the source.  Polygons for non-Federal Facility sites were updated in January, 2007 for the Superfund Work Load Models project.

The majority of the locations are derived from polygon centroids of digitized site boundaries. The remaining locations were generated from address geocoding and digitizing.   Area covered by this data set include Arizona, California, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas and Trust Territories.  Attributes include NPL status codes, NPL industry type codes and environmental indicators.  Related table, NPL_Contaminants contains information about contaminated media types and chemicals.

The TEAP divides nineteen individual measures into three main layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the diversity layer which shows land cover continuity and diversity. There are four measures that make up the diversity layer: appropriateness of land cover, contiguous size of undeveloped area, stream segments of biological significance, and the Shannon land cover diversity index. Each cell in the final diversity grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the four measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more diverse. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least diverse. In this feature class the cells are placed into the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (highest 1% of scores), 10 (highest 2 to 10% of scores), 25 (highest 11 to 25% of scores), 50 (highest 26 to 50% of scores), and 100 (all the rest of the scores). Those cells with a value of 1 represent the areas that are the highest diversity. Those with a value of 100 represent those areas with the lowest diversity.\n\nTERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; \"streamlining\" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The Texas Ecological Assessment Protocol (TEAP) is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

This feature class represents the rarity layer which shows the rarity of species and land cover in the Region. There are four measures that make up the rarity layer: vegetation rarity, natural heritage rank, taxonomic richness, and rare species richness. Each cell in the final rarity grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the four measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that have the most rarity.

Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis.  Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 14 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, and also a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity.

However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. \n\nThe EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants.

These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. \n\nA geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. \n\nA designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as ??attainment?? (meeting), ??nonattainment?? (not meeting), or ??unclassifiable?? (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. \n\nFor further information please refer to: http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html.

Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. \n\nFor further information please refer to: http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/regcntct.html).

Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis.  Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., upland game, waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, and also a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity.

It also contains the following tables: maps99.FRED_MAP_VIEWER.%fred_area_map_data and maps99.FRED_MAP_VIEWER.%fred_area_map_view. Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (http://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NAA1997Ozone8hour/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. \n\nThese layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment?? areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. \n\nThe EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. \n\nA geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. \n\nA designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as ??attainment?? (meeting), ??nonattainment?? (not meeting), or ??unclassifiable?? (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. \n\nFor further information please refer to: http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html.

For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Fresno, CA, urban water management plan data is available through the California Department of Water Resources (CADWR). Suppliers that provide over 3,000 acre-feet or serve more than 3,000 connections are required to evaluate future water supplies and implement plans to reduce 2010 baseline consumption by 20% by 2020.

The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. \n\nThe EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. \n\nA geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. \n\nA designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as ??attainment?? (meeting), ??nonattainment?? (not meeting), or ??unclassifiable?? (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. \n\nFor further information please refer to: http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html.

The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. \n\nThe EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. \n\nA geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. \n\nA designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as ??attainment?? (meeting), ??nonattainment?? (not meeting), or ??unclassifiable?? (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Durham, NC, the Division of Water Resources (DWR), part of the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources (NCDENR), has made local water supply plans centrally available online. All local governments are required to provide public water service. Community water systems with 1,000+ service connections or 3,000+ residents are required to prepare a local water supply plan. These plans include residential, also known as domestic, water usage. To account for variations due to weather, a ten-year average was calculated for Durham, Hillsborough, and the Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA), which supplies southeast Orange County, including Chapel Hill and Carrboro.

This ensures that all Americans have the same basic health and environmental protections.

The NARS analysis examined the range of values for nutrients in least-disturbed sites in a NLA region [NLA regions are modified Level III ecoregions from Omernik (1987)] and used this distribution for nitrogen and phosphorus to separate sites into those having high, medium, or low concentrations of nutrients. Sites identified as \"high\" were worse (i.e., had higher nutrient concentrations) than 95% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition. Similarly, the 75th percentile of the least-disturbed distribution was used to distinguish between sites in medium and low condition. This means that sites reported as being as \"low\" were as good as or better than 75% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition. A relative risk analysis of the data from this survey found that nationally streams and lakes have more than two times greater risk of having degraded biological communities when nutrient concentrations are high than when they are low.

The 1980 law requires the parties responsible for the contamination to conduct or pay for the cleanup. If the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) efforts to take an enforcement action for the cleanup are not successful, the federal government can clean up a site using the CERCLA Trust Fund. If the Superfund program conducts the cleanup, the government can take court action against responsible parties to recover up to three times the cleanup costs. These sites do not meet the requirements for the National Priority List, but are still part of the CERCLA list.

Biological N fixation (BNF) in natural/semi-natural ecosystems was estimated using a correlation with actual evapotranspiration (AET). This correlation is based on a global meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999). AET estimates for 2006 were calculated using a regression equation describing the correlation of AET with climate (average annual daily temperature, average annual minimum daily temperature, average annual maximum daily temperature, and annual precipitation) and land use/land cover variables in the conterminous US (Sanford and Selnick 2013). Data describing annual average minimum and maximum daily temperatures and total precipitation for 2006 were acquired from the PRISM climate dataset (http://prism.oregonstate.edu). Average annual climate data were then calculated for individual 12-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC12s; http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html; 22 March 2011 release) using the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcMap 10.0. AET for individual HUC12s was estimated using equations described in Sanford and Selnick (2013). BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems within individual HUC12s was modeled with an equation describing the statistical relationship between BNF (kg N ha-1 yr-1) and actual evapotranspiration (AET; cm yr-1) and scaled to the proportion of non-developed and non-agricultural land in the HUC12. The first half of the equation represents the most conservative estimate in a meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999), and was chosen over the central and high estimates because recent, top-down global mass balances that suggest that natural BNF rates are less than previous estimates based on scaled-up estimates from individual plots (Vitousek et al. 2013). The land use/land cover modifier is not included in the original Cleveland et al. (1999) analysis. We believe it is appropriate to include so as not to overestimate BNF in HUC12s with large proportions of urban or agricultural development. These data represent an average N input to individual HUC12s, i.e., they are not specific to an individual land use type within the HUC12.

The air photos were United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) four band (red, green, blue, and near infrared) aerial photography at 1-m spatial resolution. Aerial photography ('imagery') was collected on multiple dates in summer 2010. Seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, impervious surfaces (Impervious), soil and barren (Soil), trees and forest (Tree), and grass and herbaceous non-woody vegetation (Grass), agriculture (Ag), and Orchards. An accuracy assessment of 500 completely random and 103 stratified random points yielded an overall User's fuzzy accuracy of 81.1 percent (see below). The area mapped is defined by the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for Fresno, CA plus a 1-km buffer. Where imagery was available, additional areas outside the 1-km boundary were also mapped but not included in the accuracy assessment.

Recoverable manure is defined as manure that is collected, stored, and available for land application from confined feeding operations. County-scale data on livestock populations-needed to calculate manure inputs-were only available for the year 2007 from the USDA Census of Agriculture (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). We acquired county-level data describing total farm-level inputs (kg N/yr) of recoverable manure to individual counties in 2007 from the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) Nutrient Geographic Information System (NuGIS; http://www.ipni.net/nugis). These data were converted to per area rates (kg N/ha/yr) of manure N inputs by dividing the total N input by the land area (ha) of combined cultivated crop and hay/pasture (agricultural) lands within a county as determined from county-level summarization of the 2006 NLCD. We distributed county-specific, per area N inputs rates to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county.

The map service displays percentiles for each of the environmental indicators to provide perspective on how a selected location compares to the entire nation. EJSCREEN is an environmental justice screening tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent approach to screening for potential areas of EJ concern that may warrant further investigation. The EJ indexes are block group level results that combine multiple demographic factors with a single environmental variable (such as proximity to traffic) that can be used to help identify communities living with the greatest potential for negative environmental and health effects. The EJSCREEN tool is currently for internal EPA use only.

A TSD Facility performs one or more of the following functions: \nTreatment: Any method, technique, or process, including neutralization, designed to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of any hazardous waste so as to neutralize such waste, or so as to recover energy or material resources from the waste, or so as to render such waste non-hazardous, or less hazardous; safer to transport, store or dispose of; or amenable for recovery, amenable for storage, or reduced in volume. \nStorage: The holding of hazardous waste for a temporary period, at the end of which the hazardous waste is treated, disposed of, or stored elsewhere. \nDisposal: The discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including groundwaters. \nFRS identifies and geospatially locates facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest. Using vigorous verification and data management procedures, FRS integrates facility data from EPA's national program systems, other federal agencies, and State and tribal master facility records and provides EPA with a centrally managed, single source of comprehensive and authoritative information on facilities. This data set contains the subset of FRS integrated facilities that link to RCRAInfo hazardous waste TSD facilities once the RCRAInfo data has been integrated into the FRS database.

The TEAP divides nineteen individual measures into three main layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the sustainability layer which describes the state of the environment in terms of stability (sustainble areas are those that can maintain themselves into the future without human management). There are eleven measures that make up the sustainability layer: contiguous land cover, regularity of ecosystem boundary, appropriateness of land cover, waterway obstruction, road density, airport noise, Superfund sites, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sites, water quality, air quality, and urban/agriculture disturbance. Each cell in the final sustainability grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the eleven measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more sustainable. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least sustainable.\n\nTERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; \"streamlining\" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The Texas Ecological Assessment Protocol (TEAP) is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT LEVEL IV POLYGON LEGEND DISPLAY IN ARCMAP: Due to the limitations of Graphical Device Interface (GDI) resources per application on Windows, ArcMap does not display the legend in the Table of Contents for the ArcGIS Server service layer if the legend has more than 100 items. As of December 2011, there are 968 unique legend items in the Level IV Ecoregion Polygon legend. Follow this link (http://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/33741) for instructions about how to increase the maximum number of ArcGIS Server service layer legend items allowed for display in ArcMap. Note the instructions at this link provide a slightly incorrect path to \"Maximum Legend Count\". The correct path is HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > ESRI > ArcMap > Server > MapServerLayer > Maximum Legend Count. When editing the \"Maximum Legend Count\", update the field, \"Value data\" to 1000. To download a PDF version of the Level IV ecoregion map and legend, go to ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/us/Eco_Level_IV_US_pg.pdf.  \n\nEcoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997).

This dataset was derived from 2000 census data and based on the criteria setforth in the Region 2 Interim Environmental Justice Policy.  The two criteria for Region 2's EJ demographic analysis are percent poverty and percent minority.  The percent minority and percent poverty numbers for each blockgroup are compared to the benchmark value for the state.  Census blockgroups with percent poverty or percent minority  higher than the state threshold are considered potential EJ areas.  The cutoffs for each state were derived by using the statistical method - cluster analysis.\n\nCluster analysis was chosen as the most objective way of evaluating the demographic data and determining cutoff values for minority and low income. With cluster analysis, data are divided into two distinct groups (e.g., minority and non-minority, and low income and non-low income). Cluster analysis examines natural breaks of the data. Separate analyses were conducted for minority and low income, respectively, for each State.  All census block groups within a State were ranked in descending order according to the demographic factor under evaluation.  This resulted in a ranking for percent minority by block group and a separate ranking for percent low income by block group.  An iterative process was employed where the data were (1) split into two groups; (2) the means for each of the two groups were calculated; (3) the difference between the means for each group was determined; and (4) Steps 1- 3 were repeated until the greatest difference between the means was found.  This method results in dividing the data into two groups that are as different as possible.\n\nAll of the statistical methods evaluated indicated that minority populations in urban areas were skewing the results for the states of New York and New Jersey.  Specifically, state-wide benchmarks were similar to those derived from using only urban areas, while the results for only rural areas were considerably lowered.  Consequently,  minority data was evaluated separately for urban and rural areas within these states.  These separate analyses yield one statistical reference for the urban and one for rural for percent minority for New York and New Jersey.  Due to the special situation in Puerto Rico and Virgin Island, only percent below poverty is applied for evaluation of potential EJ community. \n\nCutoffs for % minority  \nNew York Urban  51.51 \nNew York Rural  34.73 \nNew Jersey Urban 48.52\nNew Jersey Rural   29.39 \n\nCutoffs for % below poverty \nNew York 23.59 \nNew Jersey 18.58 \nPuerto Rico 45.2 \nVirgin Island 41.2", "keyword": ["region 2", "ej", "percent minority", "percent poverty", "environmental justice", "environment", "ejepar2gis", "environmentaljusticeepar2gis", "demographicsepar2gis", "epar2gis", "environment", "environment", "new jersey", "new york", "puerto rico", "u.s. virgin islands", "ny", "nj", "pr", "us vi", "region 2", "2000"], "title": "Potential Environmental Justice (EJ) areas in Region 2 based on 2000 Census [EPA.EJAREAS_2000]", "rights": "For EPA internal use only.", "modified": "2003-01-01", "theme": ["environment"], "landingPage": "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B93C82712-A532-460E-8C49-C061FC0BCBAD%7D", "bureauCode": ["020:00"], "references": ["https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B93C82712-A532-460E-8C49-C061FC0BCBAD%7D", "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/rest/document?id=%7B93C82712-A532-460E-8C49-C061FC0BCBAD%7D"], "accrualPeriodicity": "irregular", "spatial": "-79.657367,17.672209,-62.29358,45.028448", "programCode": ["020:072"], "license": "https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.htm", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:r2gisdata@epa.gov", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 2, GIS Team, Suk-Yee Tang"}, "identifier": "{93C82712-A532-460E-8C49-C061FC0BCBAD}", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "U.S. EPA Region 1"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "This coverage contains boundaries of EPA-approved sole source aquifers.

In order to comply with Executive Order 11988, \"Floodplain Management,\" and Executive Order 11900, \"Protection of Wetlands,\" it was determined that EPA would have to ensure that these Federally-funded projects would not lead to degradation or loss of  \"Environmentally Sensitive Areas\" (ESAs) (generally wetlands and/or floodplains) due to increased development pressures brought about by the provision of  sewage treatment facilities.  In order to fund these projects, EPA had to prepare Environmental Assessments (EAs), and make a finding based on the EA that the individual project in question would not have a significant impact on the environment.  For projects where it was believed that provision of the Federally-funded sewage treatment infrastructure could lead to impacts to ESAs, a grant condition was utilized, requiring that the connection of any new construction located on a parcel in which ESAs were present that was located within the service area of the Federally-funded infrastructure project receive written approval by the Regional Administrator of Region 2 before being allowed to connect to the Federally-funded sewage treatment infrastructure in question. It is the responsibility of the grant recipient to request these waivers on behalf of  project sponsors. This data layer contains the boundaries of areas covered by  Environmentally Sensitive Area Grant Conditions as noted in the Environmental Assessments prepared for each project..

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  The American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes the following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, State-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs). Joint use areas are also included in the shapefile and mean that the area is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian / Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how the fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. \n\nThe 2010 Census boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2010, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provided the legal boundaries used in Census 2000 for the HHLs, but provided no updates since and none for the 2010 Census although there is strong evidence of HHL land acquisitions and large housing and commercial development on most HHLs.

The boundaries for State recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated State governor appointed liaisons for the 2010 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and TSAP respectively.  \n\nIn order to create this file, the U.S. EPA Region 5 aggregated the TIGER/Line state based shapefiles for Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, created map labels based on preferred Region 5 names, and gathered tribal government web site locations.

Superfund is a program administered by the EPA to locate, investigate, and clean up the worst hazardous waste sites throughout the United States. Before Superfund, Americans were less aware of how dumping chemical wastes might affect public health and the environment. Hazardous wastes were often left in the open, where they seeped into the ground, flowed into rivers and lakes, and contaminated soil and groundwater. Consequently, where these practices were intensive or continuous, there were uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites. These sites include abandoned warehouses, manufacturing facilities, processing plants, and landfills. Citizen concern about the extent of this problem prompted Congress in 1980 to establish the Superfund Program to eliminate the health and environmental threats posed by hazardous waste sites. EPA administers the Superfund program in cooperation with individual states and tribal governmentsFRS integrates facility data from EPA's national program systems, other federal agencies, and State and tribal master facility records and provides EPA with a centrally managed, single source of comprehensive and authoritative information on facilities. This data set contains the subset of FRS integrated facilities that link to CERCLIS non-NPL facilities once the CERCLIS data has been integrated into the FRS database.

For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Florida, oversight of water resources is handled by five water management districts, each comprised of a board of Governor-appointed volunteers. These Districts focus on water supply, flood protection, water quality, and natural system preservation. Tampa is in the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). Within the EnviroAtlas Tampa boundary, there are 67 service providers with 2003-2007 estimates ranging from 59 to 230 GPD.\n\nThis dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems, have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis.  Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, or cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., upland game, waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, and also a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity.

There are also a number of other federal agencies engaged in projects with Tribal, State, and local officials, and community stakeholders. Like many western river ecosystems, the Middle Rio Grande faces numerous challenges in balancing competing needs within a finite water supply and other resource constrains. Historical practices by our ancestors and immigrants to the Middle Rio Grande have established the conditions that we have inherited. Long-term drought exacerbated by climate change is changing conditions that affect natural and human communities as we strive to improve our precious Rio Grande.The Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque Urban Waters Federal Partnership will reconnect our urban communities, particularly those that are overburdened or economically distressed, with the waterway by improving coordination among federal agencies and collaborating with community-led revitalization efforts. Our projects will improve our community water systems and promote their economic, environmental and social benefits. Specifically, the Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque Urban Waters Federal Partnership will support the development of the Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge, the first urban refuge in the Southwest, as well as numerous restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque, a pilot watershed-based storm water management program, a climate change project, and transportation and economic development initiatives in the South Valley.Users can discover more about the project on the partnerships website, http://www.urbanwaters.gov/mid-riogrande/index.html.The portion of the partnership data provided by the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the project is based in significant part on data compiled in support the mapping exercise for the DOI Secretary\u00e2??s 2012 Middle Rio Grande Conservation Initiative Report http://middleriogrande.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=zWjw3lgpeyE%3d&tabid=488&mid=1401&forcedownload=true> The data compiled for this report was ultimately presented in the Appendix as maps and tabular data and ultimately no metadata was produced other than at the attribute level. The original data\u00e2??s scope was identified as applicable in support of the Urban Waters Partnership since the partnership seeks to advance the work of the America\u00e2??s Great Outdoors Initiative http://www.doi.gov/americasgreatoutdoors/index.cfm>, of which the 2012 MRG Conservation Initiative was a part of. This data represents an updated and revised dataset of similar scope with additions identifying Conservation, Education, and Recreation opportunities within the Middle Rio Grande region from Cochiti Reservoir through Elephant Butte Reservoir and as such depicts features from a more broad geographic area of interest than the Urban Waters Partnership.Originally, maintenance and restoration work was included in the point feature class of the MRG Conservation Initiative and classified as a Conservation activity; however, many of the restoration activities are better represented by a polyline feature class. The dynamic nature of the expected deployment of this data allowed for the better representation of each activity as either a point or a polyline. Subsequently, the maintenance and restoration activities have been removed from the comparible layer in the Urban Waters dataset, UrbanWaters_POIs_Points and devided into two feature classes as appropriate, MRG_Activities_line and MRG_Activities_multipoint. Unlike the Urban Waters POIs feature classes in which features share overalap in representation between point and polygon coverages, these to maintenance and restoration activity feature classes are mutually exclusive.The MRG Conservation Initiative dataset was compiled by the Technical Services Division of the Albuquerque Area Office of the Bureau of Reclamation from multiple sources. Because of the congestive nature of the static maps published in the 2012 report, several lesser projects were ommitted in 2012. The dataset for the Urban Waters Program however, while not depicting any new activities from either 2013 or 2014, has been expanded to depict all identified activities from 2002 to 2012. Many maintenance and restoration activities coincide with previous activities also resident in this dataset, therfore portions of or wholly coincident geometries may identify multiple featues discernable only through interogating the data with the identify tool.The source geometry for this feature class is a derivative of the National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) Flowline feature class. Along much of the Rio Grande, this feature class is classified as an artificial path, i.e., a geometric network path used for directed flow analysis. Often these artificial paths do not accurately represent the geometry of the river because they are covered by a polygon for cartographic purposes. In any case, the NHD is out of date, especially over dynamic features like rivers such as the Rio Grande which change annually and indeed with every precipitation or release event. Therefore, the source geometry will not reflect the ground truth alignment of the Rio Grand at larger scales. All locations are approximate and in no case does the geometry reflect or is intended to reflect the actual maintenance and restoration activities.", "keyword": ["conservation", "ecology", "ecosystem", "environment", "human", "land", "management", "natural resources", "water", "environment", "structure", "biota", "inlandwaters", "environment", "geoscientificinformation", "inlandwaters", "location", "bendway wiers", "oxbow reconnection", "reasonable and prudent alternative", "island lowering", "island destabilization", "riparian vegetation establishment", "connection bar", "albuquerque", "longitudinal stone toe", "middle rio grande conservancy district", "isc", "exotic vegetation removal", "sediment plug", "bosque del apache", "habitat creation", "office of the state engineer", "ose", "erosion prevention", "longitudinal bank lowering", "santo domingo pueblo", "levy strengthening", "pilot cut", "jetty jack removal", "river maintenance", "middle rio grande endangered species collaborative program", "swfl", "bankline embayments", "ohkay owingeh pueblo", "willow swales", "riparian habitat", "bdanwr", "bank destabilization", "floodplain", "backwater area", "saltcedar eradication", "river analysis", "infrastructure setback", "sandia pueblo", "levy widening", "santa ana pueblo", "mitigation", "bureau of reclamation", "side channel", "bioengineering", "riprap windrow", "erosion control", "u.s. army corps of engineers", "rpa", "high flow reconnection", "habitat restoration", "southwestern willow flycatcher", "rootwad", "biological opinion", "mrgcd", "levy raising", "large wood", "pilot channel", "lateral constraints removal", "biop", "bar lowering", "perennial pools", "san felipe pueblo", "usace", "interstate stream commission", "mrgescp", "location", "environment", "structure", "biota", "geoscientificinformation", "inlandwaters"], "title": "Albuquerque/Middle Rio Grande Urban Waters Viewer", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/r6/albuquerquenmurbanwaters/MapServer", "format": "API", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}, {"downloadURL": "http://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/r6/albuquerquenmurbanwaters/MapServer", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}], "rights": "None", "modified": "2014-12-01", "theme": ["environment", "geoscientificinformation", "inlandwaters", "location"], "landingPage": "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7BC24E9DCF-A112-4873-BB80-5A7AACA8CEDF%7D", "bureauCode": ["020:00"], "references": ["https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/rest/document?id=%7BC24E9DCF-A112-4873-BB80-5A7AACA8CEDF%7D", "http://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/r6/albuquerquenmurbanwaters/MapServer?f=lyr", "http://epa.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgispub.epa.gov%2Farcgis%2Frest%2Fservices%2Fr6%2Falbuquerquenmurbanwaters%2FMapServer", "http://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/r6/albuquerquenmurbanwaters/MapServer?f=nmf", "http://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/r6/albuquerquenmurbanwaters/MapServer/kml/mapImage.kmz", "http://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/r6/albuquerquenmurbanwaters/MapServer", "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7BC24E9DCF-A112-4873-BB80-5A7AACA8CEDF%7D"], "accrualPeriodicity": "irregular", "spatial": "-107.64,34.25,-105.28,36.24", "programCode": ["020:072"], "license": "https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.htm", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:kirkland.robert@epa.gov", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, Robert Kirkland"}, "identifier": "{C24E9DCF-A112-4873-BB80-5A7AACA8CEDF}", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "This feature layer contains District Boundaries for the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED).

The TEAP divides nineteen individual measures into three main layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the diversity layer which shows land cover continuity and diversity. There are four measures that make up the diversity layer: appropriateness of land cover, contiguous size of undeveloped area, stream segments of biological significance, and the Shannon land cover diversity index. Each cell in the final diversity grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the four measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more diverse. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least diverse.\n\nTERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; \"streamlining\" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The Texas Ecological Assessment Protocol (TEAP) is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

The TEAP divides nineteen individual measures into three main sub-layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the sustainability layer which describes the state of the environment in terms of stability (sustainble areas are those that can maintain themselves into the future without human management). There are eleven measures that make up the sustainability layer: contiguous land cover, regularity of ecosystem boundary, appropriateness of land cover, waterway obstruction, road density, airport noise, Superfund sites, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sites, water quality, air quality, and urban/agriculture disturbance. Each cell in the final sustainability grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the eleven measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more sustainable. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least sustainable. In this feature class the cells are placed into the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (highest 1% of scores), 10 (highest 2 to 10% of scores), 25 (highest 11 to 25% of scores), 50 (highest 26 to 50% of scores), and 100 (all the rest of the scores). Those cells with a value of 1 represent the areas that have the highest rarity. Those with a value of 100 represent those areas that have the lowest rarity.\n\nTERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; \"streamlining\" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The Texas Ecological Assessment Protocol (TEAP) is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

The REAP divides eighteen individual measures into three main sub-layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the diversity layer which shows land cover continuity and diversity. There are three measures that make up the diversity layer: appropriateness of land cover, contiguous size of undeveloped area, and the Shannon land cover diversity index. Each cell in the final diversity grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the three measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more diverse. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least diverse. In this feature class the cells are placed into the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (top 1% of scores), 10 (top 10% of scores), 25 (top 25% of scores), 50 (top 50% of scores), and 100 (all the rest of the scores).", "keyword": ["diversity, priority ecological areas, habitat, screening tools", "arkansas, ar, louisiana, la, new mexico, nm, oklahoma, ok, texas, tx, region 6, united states of america, usa, north america", "biota"], "title": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6 REAP Diversity Layer (Rank)", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/R6/REAP/r6reap_diversity.zip", "format": "API", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}, {"downloadURL": "https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/R6/REAP/r6reap_diversity.zip", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "application/octet-stream"}], "rights": "None.", "modified": "2011-01-19", "theme": ["biota"], "landingPage": "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7BBD866D64-6B5C-4E8F-91D1-C47D81CA51F1%7D", "bureauCode": ["020:00"], "references": ["https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7BBD866D64-6B5C-4E8F-91D1-C47D81CA51F1%7D", "https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/rest/document?id=%7BBD866D64-6B5C-4E8F-91D1-C47D81CA51F1%7D", "https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/R6/REAP/r6reap_diversity.zip"], "accrualPeriodicity": "irregular", "spatial": "-109.628939,25.395091,-87.944746,37.301077", "programCode": ["020:072"], "license": "https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.htm", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:osowski.sharon@epa.gov", "@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, Sharon Osowski, Ph.D."}, "identifier": "{BD866D64-6B5C-4E8F-91D1-C47D81CA51F1}", "@type": "dcat:Dataset"}, {"publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "Polygon layer of sole source aquifers in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6.

Consequently, where these practices were intensive or continuous, there were uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites. These sites include abandoned warehouses, manufacturing facilities, processing plants, and landfills. Citizen concern about the extent of this problem prompted Congress in 1980 to establish the Superfund Program to eliminate the health and environmental threats posed by hazardous waste sites.\n\nEPA administers the Superfund program in cooperation with individual states and tribal governments.

Consequently, where these practices were intensive or continuous, there were uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites. These sites include abandoned warehouses, manufacturing facilities, processing plants, and landfills. Citizen concern about the extent of this problem prompted Congress in 1980 to establish the Superfund Program to eliminate the health and environmental threats posed by hazardous waste sites.\n\nEPA administers the Superfund program in cooperation with individual states and tribal governments.

Before Superfund, Americans were less aware of how dumping chemical wastes might affect public health and the environment. Hazardous wastes were often left in the open, where they seeped into the ground, flowed into rivers and lakes, and contaminated soil and groundwater. Consequently, where these practices were intensive or continuous, there were uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites. These sites include abandoned warehouses, manufacturing facilities, processing plants, and landfills. Citizen concern about the extent of this problem prompted Congress in 1980 to establish the Superfund Program to eliminate the health and environmental threats posed by hazardous waste sites.\n\nEPA administers the Superfund program in cooperation with individual states and tribal governments.
